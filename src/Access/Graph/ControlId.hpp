// The Graph A11y Kernel — engine-neutral accessibility navigation core.
// Lifted verbatim from CyberAccess src/Graph/ (spec: docs/graph-a11y-spec.md). Lineage: Factorio
// Access key-graph.lua/menu.lua → Tanglebeep (ported with permission) → WrathAccess → RTAccess →
// CyberAccess → Sims2Access → this port (OpenXcom). Keep it byte-for-byte close to upstream so fixes
// can flow both ways. Deltas: the namespace, and C++17 spellings where upstream uses C++20 (std::erase_if).
//
// This directory is STL-only by design: NO <windows.h>, no game headers. The conformance tests
// compile Graph/** standalone, which is what enforces the kernel/host boundary.

/// Reference (optional) is the game/domain object a node was derived from (a widget instance, an
/// item), compared by POINTER IDENTITY — the kernel never dereferences it. StructuralKey (required
/// for a valid id) is a value-equatable key — a string, or a composite formatted into one
/// ("grid/3/2"). Structural keys must be stable across rebuilds for as long as the control
/// logically exists.
///
/// Two controls are "the same" when their references are identical (tier 1 — a perfect match that
/// follows an object that MOVED, its structural key changing) OR their structural keys are equal
/// (tier 2 — follows a logical control whose backing object was rebuilt: new instance, same
/// identity).
///
/// Equality/hashing is defined on StructuralKey ALONE, so a ControlId is a stable map key (the
/// graph stores nodes and traversal order by it). The reference tier is metadata, applied
/// explicitly during focus reconciliation via ReferenceMatches.
